This is a sample document for testing the SASA Software microservices system.

The system will:
1. Detect this file in the watched directory
2. Extract metadata (filename, size, timestamp, hash)
3. Send the metadata to the logger service via JWT-authenticated HTTP
4. Create a log file with the metadata
5. Move this file to the processed directory
